1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,480
True to its name, only Oracle
seemed to see this coming.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,480
Oracle is having its
biggest jump since 1992.

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,939
What a blowout quarter
for the software company.

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,500
Maybe the stock of the year.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,449
And then just days later...

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,919
TikTok's US operations is

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,770
said to be acquired by a
consortium including Oracle.

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,719
Oracle shares spike
after its named as part

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,039
of the consortium.

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,439
What was going on?

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,609
This was an old-school enterprise tech

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,429
firm tickling investors
in places only a flashy

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,109
startup normally reaches.

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,420
Because Oracle basically said that

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,380
they have almost half a
trillion dollars of contracts

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,690
to be earned in the next few years.

17
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:41,009
And that was a shocker.

18
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,030
Everyone was modeling
maybe, you know, $150 billion.

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,939
It blew away analyst expectations.

20
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,399
Now, Oracle's deeply connected to one

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,609
of the hottest social media
properties on the planet

22
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:54,659
and behind one

23
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,689
of the most ambitious infrastructure
projects on the planet.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,100
Oracle had been written off
as a kind of IBM-like company.

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,929
This is an incredible comeback story.

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,769
Clearly we had an
amazing start to the year -

27
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,644
This, is Safra Catz.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,840
Safra Catz is the CEO

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,939
and she's considered by
Wall Street to be one

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,450
of just the sharpest financial
minds out there, right?

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,370
I mean, investors love her.

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,790
Never more so than on September
9th when she stunned Wall

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,160
Street with Oracle's quarterly earnings.

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,119
They showed a spike in
bookings at a scale which nobody

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,250
had ever really seen before.

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,200
At the end of its fiscal first quarter,

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,670
Oracle's $455 billion
forecast was a fourfold

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,219
increase over the same
period a year earlier.

39
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,599
Infrastructure revenue alone will grow 77%

40
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,419
to $18 billion this fiscal year.

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,739
So yeah, it was a good day

42
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,929
to be Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison,

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,680
whose net worth soared by
$89 billion as a result,

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,100
almost enough to buy
Starbucks or four Lululemons

45
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,359
or half a Qualcomm.

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,450
That was the biggest one
day gain ever recorded on the

47
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,769
Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,080
He must have been very pleased.

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,360
You know, online commentators
were saying, okay,

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,640
it's never too old to grow, right?

51
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,529
He is a 81-year-old,

52
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,110
and briefly, he is the
world's richest man.

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,450
He started 2025 in fourth place.

54
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,359
It was only in July that
he passed Mark Zuckerberg

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,250
to move into second place, even though him

56
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,349
and Elon Musk are vying for first place.

57
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,469
Ellison is also a major
investor in Musk's company.

58
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:35,909
I'm very close friends with Elon Musk

59
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,680
and I'm a big investor in Tesla.

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,810
Musk quickly regained the title,

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,469
but that this happened at
all was a sign the world had

62
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:47,129
wildly underestimated old-timer Oracle.

63
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,799
Several things converged
to give Oracle the leg up

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
of a lifetime, and we're going
to explain what they are.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,009
But first, it's worth a quick
recap of Oracle's origin story

66
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,439
and what it is the company actually makes.

67
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,989
Larry Ellison founded
Oracle in 1977, just a year

68
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,439
after the emergence of Apple,
and two years after Microsoft.

69
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,689
In fact, he started working
in a government job at the

70
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,150
CIA, and that's how he
got the idea for Oracle.

71
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,210
It was a crowded decade on
Silicon Valley's maternity ward

72
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,254
with engineers in bell bottom
jeans delivering startup

73
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:22,210
after startup to the sound of prog rock.

74
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,790
Although, if possible,
Ellison wasn't listening

75
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,579
to anything quite as fun.

76
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,340
He wanted to help businesses
organize their private

77
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,539
data more efficiently.

78
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,799
Oracle really pioneered
the modern database.

79
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
In the early computer age,

80
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,629
just heaps of information
were being created.

81
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,469
There needed to be a mechanism
to keep track of all that.

82
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,509
Oracle's database was one

83
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,239
of the great cash cow
businesses of all time,

84
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,060
And by 2025, Oracle's
customers included some

85
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,020
of the world's best known
companies from AT&T to Walmart,

86
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,969
Accenture, and Volkswagen.

87
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,270
Their vast databases, years,
if not decades in the making,

88
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,329
think of them like the
biggest, most sensitive

89
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,550
and important folders of
spreadsheets ever known

90
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,320
to humankind.

91
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,759
They're traditionally stored in

92
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,129
what are called on-premises environments,

93
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,930
basically on servers in the offices

94
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,389
or facilities of the
companies who own them.

95
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,879
This helps ensure privacy and compliance.

96
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,329
A lot of these big
companies started using Oracle

97
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,819
databases back in the
seventies or eighties

98
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:26,740
and have never stopped.

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,750
Alright, back to the present day.

100
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,004
What did investors
think Oracle's plan is?

101
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:36,310
One is to sell inference AI
models to existing clients.

102
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,490
The other one is to basically
sell cloud computing

103
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,160
capabilities or data centers.

104
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,150
The traditional leaders here,
Amazon, Microsoft, Google,

105
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,799
they're strained for capacity.

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,730
And so Oracle figured, God,
we got all this cash flow,

107
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,939
we're printing billions off
of our other businesses.

108
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:56,319
We're able to use that

109
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,259
to underwrite our growth into
the cloud infrastructure.

110
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,949
But the plan surpassed
external expectations.

111
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,490
Here's how much Wall Street
thought Oracle's infrastructure

112
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,500
as a service business would generate over

113
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,029
the next few years.

114
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:12,879
But this is what Oracle
says it now expects.

115
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,250
Some of these buyers
like OpenAI have committed

116
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,180
to almost $300 billion in compute

117
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,750
that they want Oracle to
provide them over the course

118
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,310
of multiple years.

119
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,600
Its deals like that

120
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,580
that have really prompted this investor

121
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,899
enthusiasm around Oracle.

122
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,979
A lot of investors

123
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,970
and analysts are assuming that
if it can do deals like that,

124
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,010
there will be more coming down the line.

125
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,189
In August, Nvidia CEO
Jensen Huang said he expected

126
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,639
as much as $4 trillion to be
spent on AI infrastructure

127
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,500
by the end of the decade.

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,779
Which brings us to Project Stargate.

129
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,620
A lot of folks started paying attention

130
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,259
to Oracle this year when they
appeared at the White House,

131
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,969
next to Sam Altman, next to the president

132
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,370
announcing this Project
Stargate, this kind

133
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,160
of ambitious goal to
invest hundreds of billions

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,470
of dollars in AI infrastructure.

135
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,140
I think this will be the most
important project of this era.

136
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,940
Project Stargate is a
multi-year investment.

137
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,060
It's a partnership between
Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank

138
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,680
and the goal is to build data
centers for AI across the US.

139
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
OpenAI and Oracle have
agreed to a cloud contract,

140
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,709
which is probably the single
largest contract in history

141
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,009
to build out these massive
data centers across the US.

142
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,579
Ground has already been
broken here in Abilene, Texas,

143
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:38,569
but it's just the first and
its capacity is off the scale.

144
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,540
Oracle and OpenAI have
agreed to about four

145
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,879
and a half gigawatts of computing power.

146
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,949
That's about two Hoover Dams.

147
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,899
That's about four nuclear reactors, right?

148
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,569
I mean, this is a sum of electricity

149
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,389
that has never really been
considered for data centers.

150
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,479
And so we come to another reason.

151
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,210
Investors are taking a
fresh look at Oracle.

152
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:02,659
You look even better now.
Thank you, Mr. President.

153
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,189
He seems to have
developed a pretty close

154
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,540
relationship with the president.

155
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,780
Having that close
proximity to the president

156
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,309
it's a big positive.

157
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,230
Particularly when it comes to deals

158
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,390
and issues of national security.

159
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,899
We have to backtrack till
2020 when President Trump was

160
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,029
trying to ban TikTok, worrying
about it being a national

161
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,549
security risk, and TikTok went to Oracle

162
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,879
and said, hey, we need to
expand our infrastructure.

163
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,120
Oracle right now pretty
much runs the whole

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,819
of TikTok US assets,

165
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:36,379
and they've been doing that
over the past two plus years.

166
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:39,800
And when it comes to divesting
from the Chinese parent

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,710
company, when it comes to
getting your data in a format

168
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,019
that's gonna appease lawmakers,

169
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,969
Oracle has had a big part of this

170
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,530
And it's what led to this.

171
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,819
Bloomberg understands that Oracle

172
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,550
and Silver Lake are among the companies

173
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,220
that will acquire TikTok's US operations.

174
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,250
US operations would
be controlled by a group

175
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,420
that you know, you've come

176
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,530
to know pretty well in Silicon

177
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:01,645
Valley-

178
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:03,980
I feel like we'll be in
the retirement home one day

179
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,000
analyzing this.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,100
Well, if we are, at least
it'll now be grounded in a

181
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,230
better understanding of
the reason for excitement

182
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,819
around Oracle's blow-up numbers.

183
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,639
But let's be real, investments

184
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,469
and commitments of these scales,

185
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,900
the risks are huge.

186
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,329
Among all the hyperscaler providers,

187
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,109
Oracle is the most leveraged
and is bleeding the most cash.

188
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,530
Oracle, one of the world's
great cash cow businesses has

189
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,989
gone negative free cash
flow on this build out.

190
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,759
CEO Safra Katz said

191
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,330
that CapEx was gonna be 9
billion higher than expected,

192
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,830
and investors were excited.

193
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,300
And the reason for that is

194
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,059
that the sooner they put the CapEx in,

195
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,589
the sooner they get these data centers up

196
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,960
and running, the sooner
they can recognize revenue

197
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,700
from all these customers.

198
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,220
When you look at the
$300 billion contract

199
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,440
with OpenAI, there are two questions.

200
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,230
Question number one is
whether Oracle has the money,

201
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,659
put all the capital expenditure in

202
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,159
to buy all the Nvidia chips

203
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,230
and lease out the data centers so

204
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,120
that it can service OpenAI.

205
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,669
On the other hand, does OpenAI have the

206
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,129
$300 billion to shell out?

207
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,299
OpenAI has committed

208
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,959
to giving Oracle more money
than it has in revenue today.

209
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,750
It's assuming that the
current growth rates continue,

210
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,470
and so if anything goes wrong
there, this is a serious risk

211
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,302
for Oracle.
