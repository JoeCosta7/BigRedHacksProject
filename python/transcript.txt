[0:00:00] True to its name, only Oracle
seemed to see this coming.
[0:00:03] Oracle is having its
biggest jump since 1992.
[0:00:08] What a blowout quarter
for the software company.
[0:00:11] Maybe the stock of the year.
[0:00:13] And then just days later...
[0:00:15] TikTok's US operations is
[0:00:16] said to be acquired by a
consortium including Oracle.
[0:00:19] Oracle shares spike
after its named as part
[0:00:21] of the consortium.
[0:00:23] What was going on?
[0:00:24] This was an old-school enterprise tech
[0:00:26] firm tickling investors
in places only a flashy
[0:00:29] startup normally reaches.
[0:00:31] Because Oracle basically said that
[0:00:33] they have almost half a
trillion dollars of contracts
[0:00:37] to be earned in the next few years.
[0:00:39] And that was a shocker.
[0:00:41] Everyone was modeling
maybe, you know, $150 billion.
[0:00:45] It blew away analyst expectations.
[0:00:47] Now, Oracle's deeply connected to one
[0:00:50] of the hottest social media
properties on the planet
[0:00:53] and behind one
[0:00:54] of the most ambitious infrastructure
projects on the planet.
[0:00:58] Oracle had been written off
as a kind of IBM-like company.
[0:01:02] This is an incredible comeback story.
[0:01:10] Clearly we had an
amazing start to the year -
[0:01:13] This, is Safra Catz.
[0:01:16] Safra Catz is the CEO
[0:01:18] and she's considered by
Wall Street to be one
[0:01:20] of just the sharpest financial
minds out there, right?
[0:01:24] I mean, investors love her.
[0:01:26] Never more so than on September
9th when she stunned Wall
[0:01:29] Street with Oracle's quarterly earnings.
[0:01:32] They showed a spike in
bookings at a scale which nobody
[0:01:36] had ever really seen before.
[0:01:38] At the end of its fiscal first quarter,
[0:01:40] Oracle's $455 billion
forecast was a fourfold
[0:01:44] increase over the same
period a year earlier.
[0:01:48] Infrastructure revenue alone will grow 77%
[0:01:51] to $18 billion this fiscal year.
[0:01:54] So yeah, it was a good day
[0:01:55] to be Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison,
[0:01:57] whose net worth soared by
$89 billion as a result,
[0:02:01] almost enough to buy
Starbucks or four Lululemons
[0:02:05] or half a Qualcomm.
[0:02:07] That was the biggest one
day gain ever recorded on the
[0:02:09] Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
[0:02:10] He must have been very pleased.
[0:02:13] You know, online commentators
were saying, okay,
[0:02:15] it's never too old to grow, right?
[0:02:17] He is a 81-year-old,
[0:02:19] and briefly, he is the
world's richest man.
[0:02:22] He started 2025 in fourth place.
[0:02:24] It was only in July that
he passed Mark Zuckerberg
[0:02:27] to move into second place, even though him
[0:02:29] and Elon Musk are vying for first place.
[0:02:31] Ellison is also a major
investor in Musk's company.
[0:02:34] I'm very close friends with Elon Musk
[0:02:35] and I'm a big investor in Tesla.
[0:02:37] Musk quickly regained the title,
[0:02:39] but that this happened at
all was a sign the world had
[0:02:43] wildly underestimated old-timer Oracle.
[0:02:47] Several things converged
to give Oracle the leg up
[0:02:49] of a lifetime, and we're going
to explain what they are.
[0:02:52] But first, it's worth a quick
recap of Oracle's origin story
[0:02:56] and what it is the company actually makes.
[0:03:01] Larry Ellison founded
Oracle in 1977, just a year
[0:03:04] after the emergence of Apple,
and two years after Microsoft.
[0:03:08] In fact, he started working
in a government job at the
[0:03:10] CIA, and that's how he
got the idea for Oracle.
[0:03:13] It was a crowded decade on
Silicon Valley's maternity ward
[0:03:16] with engineers in bell bottom
jeans delivering startup
[0:03:19] after startup to the sound of prog rock.
[0:03:22] Although, if possible,
Ellison wasn't listening
[0:03:24] to anything quite as fun.
[0:03:27] He wanted to help businesses
organize their private
[0:03:30] data more efficiently.
[0:03:31] Oracle really pioneered
the modern database.
[0:03:35] In the early computer age,
[0:03:37] just heaps of information
were being created.
[0:03:40] There needed to be a mechanism
to keep track of all that.
[0:03:44] Oracle's database was one
[0:03:46] of the great cash cow
businesses of all time,
[0:03:49] And by 2025, Oracle's
customers included some
[0:03:52] of the world's best known
companies from AT&T to Walmart,
[0:03:56] Accenture, and Volkswagen.
[0:03:57] Their vast databases, years,
if not decades in the making,
[0:04:02] think of them like the
biggest, most sensitive
[0:04:04] and important folders of
spreadsheets ever known
[0:04:06] to humankind.
[0:04:08] They're traditionally stored in
[0:04:09] what are called on-premises environments,
[0:04:12] basically on servers in the offices
[0:04:13] or facilities of the
companies who own them.
[0:04:16] This helps ensure privacy and compliance.
[0:04:19] A lot of these big
companies started using Oracle
[0:04:22] databases back in the
seventies or eighties
[0:04:24] and have never stopped.
[0:04:26] Alright, back to the present day.
[0:04:28] What did investors
think Oracle's plan is?
[0:04:31] One is to sell inference AI
models to existing clients.
[0:04:36] The other one is to basically
sell cloud computing
[0:04:39] capabilities or data centers.
[0:04:42] The traditional leaders here,
Amazon, Microsoft, Google,
[0:04:46] they're strained for capacity.
[0:04:47] And so Oracle figured, God,
we got all this cash flow,
[0:04:51] we're printing billions off
of our other businesses.
[0:04:54] We're able to use that
[0:04:56] to underwrite our growth into
the cloud infrastructure.
[0:05:00] But the plan surpassed
external expectations.
[0:05:03] Here's how much Wall Street
thought Oracle's infrastructure
[0:05:06] as a service business would generate over
[0:05:08] the next few years.
[0:05:10] But this is what Oracle
says it now expects.
[0:05:14] Some of these buyers
like OpenAI have committed
[0:05:18] to almost $300 billion in compute
[0:05:22] that they want Oracle to
provide them over the course
[0:05:25] of multiple years.
[0:05:27] Its deals like that
[0:05:28] that have really prompted this investor
[0:05:30] enthusiasm around Oracle.
[0:05:31] A lot of investors
[0:05:32] and analysts are assuming that
if it can do deals like that,
[0:05:36] there will be more coming down the line.
[0:05:39] In August, Nvidia CEO
Jensen Huang said he expected
[0:05:42] as much as $4 trillion to be
spent on AI infrastructure
[0:05:45] by the end of the decade.
[0:05:47] Which brings us to Project Stargate.
[0:05:51] A lot of folks started paying attention
[0:05:53] to Oracle this year when they
appeared at the White House,
[0:05:56] next to Sam Altman, next to the president
[0:05:58] announcing this Project
Stargate, this kind
[0:06:01] of ambitious goal to
invest hundreds of billions
[0:06:04] of dollars in AI infrastructure.
[0:06:06] I think this will be the most
important project of this era.
[0:06:10] Project Stargate is a
multi-year investment.
[0:06:13] It's a partnership between
Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank
[0:06:17] and the goal is to build data
centers for AI across the US.
[0:06:21] OpenAI and Oracle have
agreed to a cloud contract,
[0:06:24] which is probably the single
largest contract in history
[0:06:27] to build out these massive
data centers across the US.
[0:06:31] Ground has already been
broken here in Abilene, Texas,
[0:06:34] but it's just the first and
its capacity is off the scale.
[0:06:38] Oracle and OpenAI have
agreed to about four
[0:06:41] and a half gigawatts of computing power.
[0:06:43] That's about two Hoover Dams.
[0:06:45] That's about four nuclear reactors, right?
[0:06:47] I mean, this is a sum of electricity
[0:06:50] that has never really been
considered for data centers.
[0:06:54] And so we come to another reason.
[0:06:56] Investors are taking a
fresh look at Oracle.
[0:06:59] You look even better now.
Thank you, Mr. President.
[0:07:02] He seems to have
developed a pretty close
[0:07:04] relationship with the president.
[0:07:05] Having that close
proximity to the president
[0:07:08] it's a big positive.
[0:07:10] Particularly when it comes to deals
[0:07:12] and issues of national security.
[0:07:14] We have to backtrack till
2020 when President Trump was
[0:07:17] trying to ban TikTok, worrying
about it being a national
[0:07:20] security risk, and TikTok went to Oracle
[0:07:22] and said, hey, we need to
expand our infrastructure.
[0:07:25] Oracle right now pretty
much runs the whole
[0:07:29] of TikTok US assets,
[0:07:31] and they've been doing that
over the past two plus years.
[0:07:36] And when it comes to divesting
from the Chinese parent
[0:07:39] company, when it comes to
getting your data in a format
[0:07:42] that's gonna appease lawmakers,
[0:07:45] Oracle has had a big part of this
[0:07:46] And it's what led to this.
[0:07:48] Bloomberg understands that Oracle
[0:07:49] and Silver Lake are among the companies
[0:07:52] that will acquire TikTok's US operations.
[0:07:55] US operations would
be controlled by a group
[0:07:58] that you know, you've come
[0:07:59] to know pretty well in Silicon
[0:08:00] Valley-
[0:08:01] I feel like we'll be in
the retirement home one day
[0:08:03] analyzing this.
[0:08:05] Well, if we are, at least
it'll now be grounded in a
[0:08:07] better understanding of
the reason for excitement
[0:08:09] around Oracle's blow-up numbers.
[0:08:12] But let's be real, investments
[0:08:13] and commitments of these scales,
[0:08:15] the risks are huge.
[0:08:17] Among all the hyperscaler providers,
[0:08:20] Oracle is the most leveraged
and is bleeding the most cash.
[0:08:24] Oracle, one of the world's
great cash cow businesses has
[0:08:27] gone negative free cash
flow on this build out.
[0:08:29] CEO Safra Katz said
[0:08:31] that CapEx was gonna be 9
billion higher than expected,
[0:08:35] and investors were excited.
[0:08:36] And the reason for that is
[0:08:38] that the sooner they put the CapEx in,
[0:08:41] the sooner they get these data centers up
[0:08:42] and running, the sooner
they can recognize revenue
[0:08:44] from all these customers.
[0:08:46] When you look at the
$300 billion contract
[0:08:49] with OpenAI, there are two questions.
[0:08:51] Question number one is
whether Oracle has the money,
[0:08:55] put all the capital expenditure in
[0:08:57] to buy all the Nvidia chips
[0:08:59] and lease out the data centers so
[0:09:01] that it can service OpenAI.
[0:09:03] On the other hand, does OpenAI have the
[0:09:05] $300 billion to shell out?
[0:09:08] OpenAI has committed
[0:09:09] to giving Oracle more money
than it has in revenue today.
[0:09:12] It's assuming that the
current growth rates continue,
[0:09:15] and so if anything goes wrong
there, this is a serious risk
[0:09:19] for Oracle.
