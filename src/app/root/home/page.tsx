            LALALALA is an entrepreneurship-focused community providing training and networking opportunities for our members, whether they have started many businesses or none. We are extremely welcoming to students with little to no business or entrepreneurship experience and offer a tailored in-house training program lasting 10 weeks that prepares new members to launch their own businesses. Both new and experienced entrepreneurs will also gain access to our network of mentors and will have the chance to join us in meeting Job Recruiters, where we will visit and network with employees at some of the world's top companies. At the culmination of each semester, members who have developed business ideas will have the opportunity to present them to our select group of external investors to receive feedback and even funding. We are devoted to facilitating professional and personal development for driven entrepreneurial students from all backgrounds looking for a tight-knit community of similarly determined people.
